        <h2 class="section-title">Personal Anecdote</h2>
        <p class="section-lede">In my first semester of college, I struggled to transition to the rigorous academic responsibilities. I was often overwhelmed and it showed in my first midterm grades. I started getting tutoring, asking my professors questions at the end of lectures, and prioritizing my mental health. After finding these strategies, I was able to improve my grades by the end of the semester. I have since then included these practices into my daily schedule to ensure a balanced and successful academic experience.</p>
