          <h3>Find a community</h3>
          <p>Creating relationships with your classmates, TA’s, and professors will make keeping up with your school work more enjoyable. You can do this by going to office hours, talking to the people you sit next to in class, and joining more clubs you are interested in.</p>

          <h2>Personal Anecdote</h2>
          <p> In my first semester of college I struggled to transition to the rigorous academic responsibilities. I was often overwhelmed and it showed in my first midterm grades. I started getting tutoring, asking my professors questions at the end of lectures, and prioritizing my mental health. After finding these strategies, I was able to improve my grades by the end of the semester. I have since then included these practices into my daily schedule to ensure a balanced and successful academic experience.</p>

          <h2>Move your body</h2>
          <p> The best way to give your brain the refresh it needs after a long day of classes is to move your body.</p>

          <h2>Get your sleep</h2>
          <p> When you sleep, your brain is processing the information it is given throughout the day. This is why it is so important we give it enough time (7 to 10 hours) to rest every night.</p>
